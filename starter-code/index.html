          <h1>  Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>
          <p>
              Instagram is a <b>fast, beautiful</b> and <b>fun</b> way to share your life with friends and family.
            <br>
              Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.
            <br>
              Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
